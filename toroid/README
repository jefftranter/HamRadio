This is a little program to calculate the inductance of ferrite and
powered iron toroidal inductors. I wrote it because I couldn't find
any free Linux-based programs to do this.

Using the program should be self-explanatory if you are familiar with
toroidal inductors.

It uses formulas and values from the ARRL Radio Amateur's Handbook.
Some combinations of parameters are not available due to lack of data.
